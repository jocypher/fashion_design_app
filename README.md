# fashion_design_app
A frontend design of a fashion app that allows you to watch and search for fashion clothes and also view different dresses
The fashion app involves the use of animated text and an in built flutter stated management called Value Notifier to add fashion clothes to a favorite section .
No backend system was implemented for the system and I implemented the routing to be able to navigate through different pages in the app.

The fashion app is a frontend design project I worked on that lets you browse and search for fashion clothes. It uses animated text and Flutter's Value Notifier to add clothes to a favorite section. The app has a routing system to navigate through different pages. With Flutter's stateful hot reload and widget catalog, you can easily make changes to the app's user interface. The app is perfect for fashion enthusiasts and anyone looking to upgrade their wardrobe.
